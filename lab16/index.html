                <p>This lab was fun to do once I started being able to play around more with how to generate the comics. I had to use some help from ChatGPT for instances such as generating random comics in my results and centering my button to show the comics. The js was a little similar to the last lab so I wasn't feeling too lost, but I did have to check in with my lab partner here and there to catch mistakes I might've made in my html or js. One thing I'm still stuck on is when I generate the comic, I can't scroll up enough to see thet of my page anymore if the comic is too big. I tried to ask Chatgpt as well, but could not find what I was looking for.</p>
