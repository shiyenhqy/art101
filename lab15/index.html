                <p>I think I had some trouble with this lab, because I was slightly confused on how to find the api for task 3, but my partner was able to help me and I feel that I have a better understanding now. I also had some button trouble and was wondering why nothing was working when I clicked on it, but was able to find out that I had accidentally wrote "lab15.js" in my script source in the html file instead of "lab.js".</p>
