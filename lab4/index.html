					<h2>How to Re-pot a Plant</h2>
					<p> 1. Buy a separate larger pot/container for plant you want to repot
						2. With the appropriate soil for plant, create a small soil base in the new pot for the plant
						3. Carefully remove the plant from its current container
						4. Place more soil in the new pot and create a supportive mound in the middle
						5. Place the plant in the new pot in the center
						6. Fill the pot with soil and secure plant
						7. Water the plant 
						8. Place in a spot with the right light and temperature conditions

					<h2>Pseudocoding "Rock-Paper-Scissors" Game</h2>
					<p> 1. Find a friend
						2. Count “rock”, “paper”, “scissors” 
						3. Do a hand motion (rock, paper, or scissors) at the same time
						4. Figure out who won
						   a. Rock > scissors, scissors > paper, paper > rock

					<p>// find a friend (over the internet)
						     // make buttons for “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”
						     // have countdown 
						    	// (start loop) start the game :D
						        // begin countdown for choosing one button
						        // each player picks a button but their choice is hidden from the other player
						        // button selection is locked once countdown ends
					         	// print “rock”, then “paper”, then “scissors” on the screen
							    // print “shoot” on the screen
						    	// print both player picks onto the screen
							    // check for winner and loser
								    // winner = ROCK when rock and scissor, SCISSOR when scissor and paper, PAPER when paper and rock
								    // loser = ROCK when rock and paper, SCISSOR when scissor and rock, PAPER when paper and scissors
								    // if both players pick the same thing, loop!
