					<h2>What is this Lab?</h2>
					<p>The objective of this lab is to work with a partner to create local file structures on your computer, add index.html files, and upload them to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Difficulties</h2>
					<p>I think I am starting to understand more of how to structure the content within the HTML because it almost feels like a paper whereas if I place something above, it shows above, and if placed below, it shows below. I feel that if I were to do it from scratch, I could figure it out because it feels like a sandwich, but I would still definitely struggle trying to recreate the order and trying to do more advanced stuff beyond just structuring it.

					<h2>Results</h2>
