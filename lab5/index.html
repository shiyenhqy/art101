					<h2 style="color: #ffffff">Challenges</h2>
					<p>At first, I found it a little confusing typing in the variables into the console in the first task. I kept having to rewrite it because I kept making minor mistakes and typos or forgetting to add symbols. I also had some guidance from my partner in writing out the variable for the age part which I was a little confused about.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2 style="color: #ffffff">Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems I faced was writing in the "document.writeln" and getting it to show on my website. With help of my T.A. and my partner, I learned how to use Inspect on my website to see where any problems might be in my js file.</p>
