                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>

                <p>I think this lab was a little harder for me to understand, but through using the guiding instructions on the assignment pages, I was able to use a similar format but different subject. I was also able to use a css code to move my text box and submit button in the middle that my partner had taught me to use from the last lab.</p>

            <div class="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Instead of going the Hogwarts route like in the example, I decided to do a sorter that places you as a type of dog.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="input-output">
                <h2>What Dog Are You?</h2>
