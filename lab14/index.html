                <p>I believe most of my labs had more css-based improvements I could have made, so the only lab I found that I could debug was Lab 8. I remember I had gotten feedback that my third array printed out with the same results as the previous one, so I tried fixing that by reworking the js file. I tried not to use any outside resources for help and attempted to fix it solely in the js file alone, which was a success. At first, I had followed the model quite closesly in the Lab 8 page example, but I decided to instead change it for the multiplication of three part of my JS file to imitate the same format I used for the addition of 1 to my array.</p>
