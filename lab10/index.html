                <p>While working this lab, I think most of my problems were mainly due to mistyping things in my js file and adding/not adding things that I had to take multiple looks over again. I had to do a lot of refreshing of my website, as I was testing each change out every second. I took a victory sigh of relief when I was finally able to get the buttons on my page. I had to do a lot of reworking with adding functions to the buttons, because I got a little confused when formatting it out in my js file. I figured it out though and I think it helped being able to see what I was changing and what was not changing.</p>
