            <h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>This lab was a little intimidating at first to me, but as I was checking in with my partner as I did each task step by step, I foundt that I actually understood more than I thought I did. I think this lab served more as a confirmation that I am actually learning how to code even though I am a bit hesitant to type things out entirely by myself.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Check the console!</p>
