					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Most of the difficulties I faced was mainly trying to understand why I was typing the transports and repeating the main ride. I tried my best to follow the instructions and made sure to check in frequently with my partner to make sure I had the right ideas. I had a general idea of what to type into the console and my js file, but I was still a little puzzled about js in general, though I figured out what to write.</p>
